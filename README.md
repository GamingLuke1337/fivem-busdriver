# Bus Driver Job
ESX Job for being a bus driver.
This script was written from scratch as practice for the up coming delivery driver job I wish to write.


# Installation
## Requirements
- FiveM
- esx
- esx_addonaccount
- esx_skin
- mysql_async

## Via Git ( recommended )
From your resouces directory for the ESX server:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lachee/fivem-busdriver.git "[lachee]/lachee-busdriver"
```

Then in you server cfg:
- `ensure lachee-busdriver`

**Ensure you migrate your database with the `sql/*.sql` scripts.**

## TODO

- Give some stops (especially rural stops) a place for peds to wait
